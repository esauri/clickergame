Clicker Game is a web game using canvas. The goal of the game is to click on enemies before they get angry. Failing to do so will allow them to hurt Bob and when Bob's health reaches zero the game is over. Clicking on enemies can also heal Bob or grant it protective shields so it can deter coming attacks. For media the popping sound emitted when clicking an enemy was made by greenvwbeetle and the shield sound is by thehorriblejoke. The art is slightly edited by me but was created by Kenney Vleugels.
